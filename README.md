datez: convert a time into several timezones
============================================

In July, when it is 16:00 in Canberra, what time is it in Caracas, and
where I am in Cambridge?

        $ datez 2021-07-21.16:00:00 Australia/Canberra America/Caracas
        2021-07-21.06:00:00+0000 (UTC)
        2021-07-21.16:00:00+1000 (Australia/Canberra)
        2021-07-21.02:00:00-0400 (America/Caracas)
        2021-07-21.07:00:00+0100 (Europe/London)


install
-------

`datez` is written in Rust, so use [`cargo install`][cargo].

[cargo]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-install.html

We have tested `datez` on:

  * Unix
      * FreeBSD
      * Debian Linux
      * macOS
  * Windows
      * cmd.exe
      * Powershell

usage
-----

        datez <time> <zone>...

You should wite the time in ISO 8601 / RFC 3339 format but _without_ a
UTC offset, and list as many tz database timezone names as you want.

The time is read using the first timezone; it is converted to UTC and
printed in UTC and in every timezone you listed, and in your local
timezone (if possible).

The local timezone is discovered from the `TZ` environment variable
if that is set, or by an OS-specific mechanism; it isn't an error
if neither of those work, but you have to list your timezone
explicitly.

On Unix, `datez` reads the symlink at `/etc/localtime`.

On Windows, `datez` calls Win32 `GetTimeZoneInformation()`.
